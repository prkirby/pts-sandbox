## Ideas for Sketches

- When text or word is on center of screen, it is mirrored and distributed many times randomly in the background, all of it with random cardinal directions and orientations, entering from offscreen
- Fractal tree with leaves that fall and create generative music. Maybe fed from a weather center of choice? Or specific data stream?
- Find interesting or obscure math principle, and use it as a basis for a sketch.
- Generate an animation based on an image uploaded ( have abililty to share it). Eventually could integrate generated music into it.
- Build out Golden Ratio "flower" example IE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj8Sg8qnjOg
